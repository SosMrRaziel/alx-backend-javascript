## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was originally designed for adding interactivity to web pages. It is now widely used for both front-end and back-end development, as well as for building desktop and mobile applications.

## Why Use JavaScript?

JavaScript offers several advantages for web development:

- **Versatility**: JavaScript can be used for both client-side and server-side development, making it a versatile language for full-stack development.
- **Interactivity**: JavaScript allows you to add dynamic and interactive elements to your web pages, such as form validation, animations, and event handling.
- **Large Community**: JavaScript has a large and active community of developers, which means there are plenty of resources, libraries, and frameworks available to help you build your projects.
- **Compatibility**: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a reliable choice for web development.

## Getting Started

To start using JavaScript, you'll need a text editor and a web browser. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Open your favorite text editor and create a new file with a `.js` extension (e.g., `script.js`).
2. Write your JavaScript code in the file.
3. Save the file.
4. Open a web browser and create a new HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).
5. Link your JavaScript file to the HTML file using the `<script>` tag.
